# GBV-web-app-project
This project aims to create a secure web platform for victims of gender-based violence in Nigeria to anonymously report incidents. It will offer resources like emergency contacts, legal aid, and safety tips, while prioritizing user privacy. The goal is to discreetly empower users with access to help and support without fear of exposure.
